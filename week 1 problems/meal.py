Suppose you're in a country where you...
    Eat breakfast between 7:00 and 8:00
    Eat Lunch between 12:00 and 13:00
    Eat Dinner between 18:00 and 19:00

Implement a program that prompts the user for a time
Outputs
    Breakfast time
    Lunch time
    Dinner time
If it's not time for a meal, don't output anything at all
Assume the users input is in 24 hour time as
    #:## or ##:##
Assume that the meal's time range is inclusive
    So it's either 7:00, 8:00, or in between any of those times
